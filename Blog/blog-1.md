<!-- The significance of union and intersection types in Typescript. -->

Union and intersection types in TypeScript are essential for creating flexible and expressive type definitions, It enables developers to work with complex data structures and logic. 

 Union types allow us to specify that a variable can be of multiple types. This is particularly useful when dealing with function parameters or return types that can have different types. For example, we can define a function that accepts either a string or a number:

   
   function printValue(value: string | number) {
     console.log(value);
   }

   printValue("Hello"); // Valid
   printValue(10); // Valid
   printValue(true); // Error: Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string | number'
   

   Union types can also be used to model complex data structures, such as discriminated unions (also known as tagged unions or algebraic data types).


 Intersection types allow us to combine multiple types into a single type that has all the properties of the combined types. This is useful when we  want to create a type that represents the intersection of two or more types. For example, we can define a type that represents a person with both a name and an age:

   
   type Person = { name: string; age: number };
   type Employee = { jobTitle: string; salary: number };

   type FullEmployee = Person & Employee;

   const john: FullEmployee = {
     name: "John",
     age: 30,
     jobTitle: "Software Engineer",
     salary: 50000,
   };
   

   Intersection types can also be used to create more specific types by combining existing types with interfaces or type aliases.

So we can say,  union and intersection types in TypeScript provide a powerful way to create flexible and expressive type definitions, enabling developers to work with complex data structures and logic. They allow us to model complex scenarios, enforce type safety, and improve code readability and maintainability.
